# conda activate pyroenv
# conda deactivate

# on macbook M1 pro, only the following Pytorch was compatible
- pytorch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.0 torchaudio==2.0.0 -c pytorch

```
conda install pytorch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.0 torchaudio==2.0.0 -c pytorch
```
# using the latest versiobn Pytorch 2.0.1 gives the following ValueError

```
warn(f"Failed to load image Python extension: {e}")
```
this is an unresolved error by Pytorch which has root cause in torchvision and pytorch version compatibility
