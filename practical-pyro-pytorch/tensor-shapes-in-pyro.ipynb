This is analogous to d-separation in graphical models: it is always safe to add edges and assume variables may be dependent (i.e. to widen the model class), but it is unsafe to assume independence when variables are actually dependent (i.e. narrowing the model class so the true model lies outside of the class, as in mean field). In practice Pyro’s SVI inference algorithm uses reparameterized gradient estimators for Normal distributions so both gradient estimators have the same performance."

    "### Broadcasting to allow parallel enumeration\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyro 0.2 introduces the ability to enumerate discrete latent variables in parallel. This can significantly reduce the variance of gradient estimators when learning a posterior via SVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use parallel enumeration, Pyro needs to allocate tensor dimension that it can use for enumeration. To avoid conflicting with other dimensions that we want to use for plates, we need to declare a budget of the maximum number of tensor dimensions we’ll use. This budget is called max_plate_nesting and is an argument to SVI (the argument is simply passed through to TraceEnum_ELBO). Usually Pyro can determine this budget on its own (it runs the (model,guide) pair once and record what happens), but in case of dynamic model structure you may need to declare max_plate_nesting manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand max_plate_nesting and how Pyro allocates dimensions for enumeration, let’s revisit model1() from above. This time we’ll map out three types of dimensions: enumeration dimensions on the left (Pyro takes control of these), batch dimensions in the middle, and event dimensions on the right.\n",
