    "\n",
    "Consider the problem of sampling from the posterior distribution of a probabilistic model with \n",
    " or more continuous latent variables, but whose data fits entirely in memory. (For larger datasets, consider amortized variational inference.) Inference in such high-dimensional models can be challenging even when posteriors are known to be unimodal or even log-concave, due to correlations among latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform inference in such high-dimensional models in Pyro, we have evolved a workflow to incrementally build data analysis pipelines combining variational inference, reparametrization effects, and ad-hoc initialization strategies. Our workflow is summarized as a sequence of steps, where validation after any step might suggest backtracking to change design decisions at a previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of efficient workflow is to ensure changes don’t break your pipeline. That is, after you build a number of pipeline stages, validate results, and decide to change one component in the pipeline, you’d like to minimize code changes needed in other components. The remainder of this tutorial describes these steps individually, then describes nuances of interactions among stages, then provides an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running example: SARS-CoV-2 strain prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The running example in this tutorial will be a model of the relative growth rates of different strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on open data counting different PANGO lineages of viral genomic samples collected at different times around the world. There are about 2 million sequences in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a high-dimensional regression model with around 1000 coefficients, a multivariate logistic growth function (using a simple torch.softmax()) and a Multinomial likelihood. While the number of coefficients is relatively small, there are about 500,000 local latent variables to estimate, and plate structure in the model should lead to an approximately block diagonal posterior covariance matrix.\n"

    "### Create a generative model\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to using Pyro is creating a generative model, either a python function or a pyro.nn.Module. Start simple. Start with a shallow hierarchy and later add latent variables to share statistical strength. Start with a slice of your data then add a plate over multiple slices. Start with simple distributions like Normal, LogNormal, Poisson and Multinomial, then consider overdispersed versions like StudentT, Gamma, GammaPoisson/NegativeBinomial, and DirichletMultinomial. Keep your model simple and readable so you can share it and get feedback from domain experts. Use weakly informative priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll focus on a multivariate logistic growth model of competing SARS-CoV-2 strains, as described in Obermeyer et al. (2022). This model uses a numerically stable logits parameter in its multinomial likelihood, rather than a probs parameter. Similarly upstream variables init, rate, rate_loc, and coef are all in log-space. This will mean e.g. that a zero coefficient has multiplicative effect of 1.0, and a positive coefficient has multiplicative effect greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note we scale coef by 1/100 because we want to model a very small number, but the automatic parts of Pyro and PyTorch work best for numbers on the order of 1.0 rather than very small numbers. When we later interpret coef in a volcano plot we’ll need to duplicate this scaling factor."
